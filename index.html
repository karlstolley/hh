      <h2>Project 1: Digital Literacy Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        This project asks you to create some kind of digital story about how you became literate in
        using digital communication technologies. Included in the story somehow should be a second
        story of your experience teaching yourself the rudiments of some new digital communication
        practice that you will use to create and share your project. While the primary media you
        will write in should be text, you may enhance that with any other type of media you choose
        (image, audio, video).
      </p>
      <p>
        You will first send a <b>proposal email</b> to the instructor with the new digital
        communication technology you intend to learn for creating your project, along with a rough
        idea of how you will construct your story. Keep in mind that common word processors (Word,
        Mac Pages, Google Docs) are not allowed in this class (but you most likely know how to use
        those anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as you draft your narrative, you will turn in two in-progress drafts; the drafts
        should be shared as Dropbox share links that you email to the instructor. Those are due on
        30 January and 6 February (both Fridays). If you opt to learn something that is
        Web-available, you can send the link to the project wherever it's hosted, rather than a
        Dropbox share link.
      </p>
      <h3>Deliverables &amp; Deadlines</h3>
      <ol class="deliverables">
        <li>Proposal email to instructor (by Friday, 23 January)</li>
        <li>Draft No. 1 in an email with a Dropbox link (due Friday, 30 January)</li>
        <li>Draft No. 2 in an email with a Dropbox link (due Friday, 6 February)</li>
        <li>Final Draft in an email with a Dropbox link (due Tuesday, 10 February)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Project 2: Reflective Digital Presence</h2>
      <p>
        During the months of February and March and into early April,
        you will blog or privately journal weekly about your activities
        being digitally present (e.g., through social media like
        Twitter, social reading sites like Reddit). Additionally, you
        will join a new community or service and begin to establish a
        presence there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary deliverable for this project is your blog/journal. You may write about anything
        you like regarding your digital presence: for example, the different rhetorical identities
        you notice yourself projecting on, say, Facebook versus Yik Yak; or perhaps a major local,
        national, or world news event and how it unfolds on Twitter. As we begin reading Negroponte,
        and supporting articles about digital being &amp; presence, you should compare your own
        experiences to the predictions, observations, and arguments in the materials we read for
        class.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul class="requirements">
        <li>You must be present on two different services/networks (e.g., Twitter and Pintrest)</li>
        <li>You must join for the first time at least one new network</li>
        <li>Your blog/private journal should contain between 2 and 5 entries per week</li>
        <li>You DO NOT have to share your accounts usernames or URLs with the instructor</li>
        <li>BUT, you should include samples (which can be anonymized by changing the names/usernames of anyone you mention) in your blog/journal from what you’ve posted on the sites you’re present on</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deliverables &amp; Deadlines</h3>
      <ol class="deliverables">
        <li>Proposal email to instructor (by Monday, 2 February) outlining:
          <ol>
            <li>The social sites/networks that you will be present on</li>
            <li>The new site/network that you will join</li>
            <li>The format (blog or private journal) that you will keep for the project, and either the blog URL or Dropbox share link to the private journal that you'll keep</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          In-progress blog/journal reviews for instructor feedback on the following Fridays: 13 Feb, 27 Feb, 13 Mar and 27 Mar
        </li>
        <li>
          Final blog/journal submission on 3 April

      <h2>Project 3: Collaborative Learning, Collaborative Writing</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, you will work in small teams to develop your own abilities to write and
        collaborate digitally on a project that teaches IIT faculty members how to assign and
        support students pursuing alternatives to "the paper" for course projects. Full project
        details by February 10.

      <p>
        You will be assigned a random Thursday over the course of the semester to present a 10- to
        15-track Spotify playlist. The tracks in your playlist should be both autobiographical
        somehow in that it says something about you, but should also be connected to the course
        materials that week in some way. For each track, you will offer a max 140-character story
        explaining why you included the track in your playlist.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul class="requirements">
        <li>A 10- to 15-track playlist created with only the music available on Spotify</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Late Work</h3>
  <p>
    I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each
    project description.
  </p>

  <h2>Attendance and Participation</h2>
  <p>
    Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the class,
    and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss, please
    contact me ahead of time via email. Students missing more than two consecutive class meetings
    will automatically fail the course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding active participation: I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading.
    And I expect you to come prepared to discuss that reading.
  </p>

  <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>
    As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
    <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml">the Code of Academic Honesty as described in the IIT Student
    Handbook</a>. All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and
    digital page design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use
    of open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
    legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage, dissemination,
    and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the source’s terms of service,
    licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may
    violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the work is due.
    The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates the Code of
    Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will
    report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities, who may take additional
    disciplinary action, including reporting violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or
    Graduate Academic Affairs.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore essential to
    this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies as for any
    other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being
    unprepared for class.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it is
    your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance provided in
    class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to meet with me during
    my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to contact me via email or
    GChat, or our Campfire room, well in advance of project deadlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with
    nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is expected that
    you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more important than perfection.
    Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night before a project is due.
  </p>

  <h2>Accessibility and Special Needs Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to
    receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for
    Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S.
    State Street - 1C3-2. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at
    disabilities@iit.edu
  </p>
  <p>
    Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability
    to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email, at the start of
    the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be
    adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all students.
